## 3. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND JURISDICTION

### 3.1 Constitutional Supremacy Framework

This Privacy Policy operates under the constitutional supremacy framework established by **Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution** (the Supremacy Clause), which declares federal law to be the "supreme law of the land." Federal Indian law establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over matters involving tribal sovereignty and Indigenous data governance.

**Federal Preemption:** This Privacy Policy invokes federal preemption to ensure that Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles and tribal jurisdiction are protected from state law interference or concurrent jurisdiction claims that would undermine federal protections for Indigenous data and cultural heritage.

### 3.2 Tribal Jurisdiction and Sovereign Immunity

**Tribal Court Primacy:** Any disputes arising from or relating to this Privacy Policy, including disputes concerning data collection, use, disclosure, security, or Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, shall be subject to the **exclusive jurisdiction of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians Tribal Court**, located in Peshawbestown, Michigan.

**Sovereign Immunity Preservation:** Nothing in this Privacy Policy constitutes a waiver of the Rights Holder's tribal sovereign immunity or the sovereign immunity of GTBOCI. The Rights Holder expressly reserves all sovereign immunity protections.

**Limited Waiver for Enforcement:** The Rights Holder may, in their sole discretion, elect to pursue enforcement actions in federal courts with established expertise in federal Indian law, but such election does not constitute a general waiver of sovereign immunity.

### 3.3 State Court Prohibition

**No State Jurisdiction:** State courts have **NO jurisdiction** over disputes arising from this Privacy Policy. Any attempt to invoke state court jurisdiction violates federal law and tribal sovereignty.

**Automatic Removal:** Any action filed in state court shall be subject to immediate removal to federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, followed by transfer to tribal court or dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.

**Liquidated Damages for State Filings:** Filing any action in state court in violation of this jurisdictional provision subjects the filing party to liquidated damages of **$100,000** payable to the Rights Holder, plus all costs and attorneys' fees incurred in removal and jurisdictional challenges.

### 3.4 International Framework Integration

This Privacy Policy implements protections consistent with:

**a) UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP):**
- Article 31: Right to maintain, control, protect, and develop cultural heritage, TK, TCEs, and intellectual property
- Article 32: Right to determine priorities for development or use of lands, territories, and resources

**b) WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (2024):**
- Mandatory disclosure requirements for uses of TK
- Prior Informed Consent obligations
- Benefit-sharing arrangements

**c) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):**
- Enhanced rights for EU residents
- Lawful basis requirements for Processing
- Data protection by design and by default

**d) California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):**
- Consumer rights to know, delete, and opt-out
- Prohibition on sale of Personal Data without consent
- Rights to correct inaccurate information

**e) Emerging Global Privacy Standards:**
- Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)
- Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) and similar state laws

### 3.5 Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

In the event of conflicts between privacy frameworks, the following hierarchy applies:

1. **Tribal sovereignty and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles** (highest priority)
2. **Federal Indian law** protections
3. **International Indigenous rights instruments** (UNDRIP, WIPO Treaty)
4. **Federal privacy laws** (e.g., COPPA, HIPAA where applicable)
5. **State privacy laws** (CCPA, VCDPA, etc.)
6. **International privacy regulations** (GDPR, LGPD, etc.)
